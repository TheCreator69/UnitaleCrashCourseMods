## How to Download
Downloading the mods for yourself is super easy!\
There are multiple ways to download code from GitHub, so I will describe the most straight-forward method here:

1. Click on the `Code` button in the top right
2. Select `Download .zip`
3. Once the .zip file has been downloaded, unzip it with a program of your choosing. Popular options for this are [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) and [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html)
4. The unzipped folders each represent a mod. Put them all in the "Mods" folder of your Unitale installation
5. Open Unitale and the mods should appear. If you already have Unitale opened, click `Exit` in the top left corner and open the mod selection screen again to refresh

## Help, your mods aren't working!
I strive to write robust code that works right out of the box. Before you complain in my Discord, on my YouTube channel or even open an issue here on GitHub, you should check the following things:

- [x] ~~Your own sanity~~
- [x] Unitale can run other mods without any problems. If this isn't the case, then your installation may be faulty.
- [x] The mods are visible in the mod selection screen. If this isn't the case, then you didn't follow the installation steps properly.
- [x] There is an error message when opening one of my mods that specifies a line where the error resides.

If all these conditions are met, then your next course of action is to [create an Issue here on GitHub.](https://github.com/TheCreator69/UnitaleCrashCourseMods/issues/new) \
If you don't know how to do that, then check [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-issues) \
I will do my best to fix the problem ASAP if it is my fault and I can fix it. \

Thank you for reading and have fun! :smile:
